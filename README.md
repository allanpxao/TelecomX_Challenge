# TelecomX_Challenge

##Telecom Customer Churn Analysis
###Project Overview
This repository contains a comprehensive analysis of customer churn for a fictional telecommunications company. The primary goal of this project is to dive into the data to identify the key profiles, behaviors, and factors that contribute to customer churn.

Based on these insights, the project culminates in a set of actionable, data-driven strategic recommendations that the company can implement to increase customer retention and strengthen loyalty.

###The Business Problem
A high customer churn rate is one of the biggest challenges for subscription-based service companies, directly impacting revenue and sustainable growth. This analysis seeks to answer the following key questions:

What are the demographic and contract profiles of customers who are most likely to churn?

Which services or payment methods are most associated with churn?

How does the combination of contract tenure and spending affect the decision to churn?

What data-driven actions can we take to mitigate churn?

###Methodology
The analysis followed a structured data science pipeline:

####Data Cleaning and Preprocessing: Verifying data integrity, correcting data types, handling missing values, and formatting to ensure the quality of the analysis.

####Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Generating descriptive statistics and a wide range of visualizations (bar charts, pie charts, line graphs, and scatter plots) to uncover patterns, anomalies, and relationships between variables.

####Synthesis of Insights and Recommendations: Translating statistical findings into business conclusions and proposals for strategic action.

###Technologies Used
Language: Python 3.x

###Libraries:

Pandas (for data manipulation and analysis)

Matplotlib & Seaborn (for static data visualization)
